project:
Have a quick overview of the features and implement a “cleaning process”. Make sure this part of the code is well organised, if possible make this an object-oriented exercise.
Explain the process that needs to happen for each feature before you train your model. Also, think about how future observations might be different from the ones you have! Be creative. 
Explain in your own words what is the importance of designing and implementing a pipeline? 
Choose one metric to evaluate the different models you will train and explain why you are choosing that instead of other traditional ones.
Select three different models that you would like to test your dataset with. Make sure that at least two of them are tree-based models. 
Explain why you selected these three models. You might want to discuss their peformance, explainability, complexity, etc. 
make a comparative analysis between the performance of your models.
